Two numbers will be added in hexadecimal format. The hexadecimal prefix is  ”0x” and is not to be
considered in any conversion process. The uint32t data type in C/C++ is being used to
store the number as an unsigned 32-bit number.
The provided text file is used as an example input. This program reads the command (ADD), and it will perform the
addition between the two hexadecimal numbers. 
The result of the addition operation is displayed to the terminal and build
environment.
